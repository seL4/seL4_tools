# Turns a selection of CakeML HOL scripts (Script.sml files) into a library that can
# be linked against. Note that the library *only* contains the output of the CakeML
# compiler, and it may have hanging symbols to ffi functions that need to be fullfilled
# The position argument library_name is the name of the library that will be created and
# is directly passed to addlibrary in the end
# Other arguments are
#  SOURCES - One or more Script.sml files to use when performing compilation. These will
#   all get copied into a flat directory structure for the actual build
#  TRANSLATION_THEORY - This is the name of the theory that does the final `append_prog`
#   command. As a result you almost certainly pass a TRANSLATION_THEORYScript.sml file
#   as one of the SOURCES
#  CAKEML_ENTRY - Defines the 'entry' function in your CakeML program that should get called
#   by the CakeML runtime on startup
#  RUNTIME_ENTRY - Symbol exported from the library that you can call to enter the CakeML
#   runtime. Note that CakeML does not return and so this function is divergent
#  STACK_SIZE - Size of the stack for the CakeML runtime in MB - default is 1000
#  HEAP_SIZE - Size of the heap for the CakeML runtime in MB - defaultis 1000
#  DEPENDS - List of any additional targets to depend upon
#  INCLUDES - List of any additional INCLUDES to add to the INCLUDES list in the Holmakefile
